0.0.4 Release
=============

 * Invert save logic, so only files explicitly defined in the
   configuration file are saved in the flash instead of the entire
   directory.  This makes it easier to handle the situations where
   only a limited number of files needs to be saved, and where the
   base (read-only) directory structure might evolve over time.

   The flash format is backwards compatible, but there's two
   user-visible changes to the configuration file:

     - The MOUNTPOINT setting is no longer optional
     - The SAVE setting has to be set to the list of file names to save
       (shell wildcards are allowed)

0.0.3 Release
=============

 * Support platform specific on_setup handler.

0.0.2 Release
=============

 * Support remounting underlying static contents somewhere else.

0.0.1 Release
=============

 * First release!
